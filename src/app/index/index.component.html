        <div class="container">
          <p class="text-justify">
            Hospitalmanagement System houses a unique portfolio of services that
            keep healthcare professionals abreast of the latest and most significant
            developments within their clinical, surgical or management area.

            Covering all aspects of the hospital environment, Hospitalmanagement
            System provides both clinical and senior administrative staff with
            instant access to a comprehensive reference source introducing
            technologies, services and procedures our audience can employ to improve
            the management of their facilities.

            The site is complemented by two specialist journals, Practical Patient
            Care and Medical Imaging Technology concentrating on woundcare and
            infection control and medical imaging and radiology respectively.

            Both titles are circulated to an audience that includes not only
            clinicians with the authority to recommend new products, but also the
            managerial staff responsible for purchasing. By reaching both ends of
            the procurement chain we offer our advertisers the best possible
            platform from which to sell their services.
